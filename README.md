# Yarn Spinner Bolt Helper

An addon to help integrate YarnSpinner with Unity's Bolt. This package includes Super Units and scripts to allow you to access YarnSpinner components with the default dialogue UI script, and even build your own entirely in Bolt.

## Requirements

* Yarn Spinner 1.2.6
* Bolt 1.4.x (tested with 1.4.13)

This integration will not work with Yarn Spinner 2.0 or later, and there are no plans for 2.0 support with this helper.

## Installing

After installing YarnSpinner and Bolt (and installing YarnSpinner in Bolt), simply install the Unity Package and rebuilt the unit options (Tools > Bolt > Built Unit Options).
To use the basic helper, attach the `BoltYarnSpinnerHelper.cs` script onto wherever your `DialogueRunner.cs` script is, or alternatively you can use the "Dialogue & BoltHelper" prefab instead of the "Dialogue" prefab provided by YarnSpinner.

## Usage
